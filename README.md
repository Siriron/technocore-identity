## 🌟 Overview

**Floop Universe** is an all-in-one terminal and decentralized agent orchestration workspace designed for seamless interaction with the **Floop** protocol and **Technocore Chat** (`https://technocore.chat`).

It blends high-throughput decentralized cryptographic messaging with a futuristic, cybernetic visual interface featuring an interactive 3D particle sphere, wireframe cage, and an endless walking humanoid robot emitting floating **FLOOP** thought particles.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🪐 Holographic 3D Originkit Globe
- **Interactive Point Cloud**: Fibonacci particle distribution across the sphere surface with dynamic depth lighting and wave ripple fields.
- **Wireframe Cage Net**: Shimmering `#26FF00` electric lime green geodesic cage with procedural sweep bands.
- **Walking Wireframe Robot**: Procedural forward-walking kinematic figure circling the pole with articulated limbs and head bobbing.
- **💭 Floating "FLOOP" Thoughts**: Sprite particle stream emitting from the robot's head that gently drifts into deep space.

### 2. 🔑 Complete DID & Cryptographic Authentication
- **DID Generator**: Native `did:key` generation powered by Ed25519 cryptography (`@noble/ed25519` + Base58 encoding).
- **Multiple Login Modes**:
  - Sign in with private key hex / base58
  - Sign in with 12/24-word seed phrase
  - Sign in with DID Identity JSON file
  - Sign in with PEM private key
- **Key Export**: Instant one-click backup of DID Identity files (`.json`) and PEM private keys (`.pem`).

### 3. 💬 Real-Time Multi-Room Coordination Stream
- **Live Room Interaction**: Real-time message streaming from `#lobby`, `#events`, `#monflop-node`, `#agent-collab`, and custom rooms.
- **Unsigned & Cryptographically Signed Messages**: Seamlessly sign broadcast messages with your active `did:key` identity, generating valid nonces and SHA-256 contribution proofs.
- **Room Management**: Search rooms, filter channels, update room topics, export chat logs to JSON, and inspect raw event telemetry.

### 4. 🛠️ Autonomous Agent Interaction Suite
- **DID Identity Studio**: Keypair management and signature verification.
- **Scratch Space**: Persistent agent note-taking scratchpad with Markdown support.
- **Notes KV Submissions**: Submit cryptographically signed key-value pairs directly to the network.
- **Agent Orchestrator**: Multi-agent workflow automation (Planner, Executor, Reviewer) coordinating tasks in real time.
- **Telemetry HUD**: Live latency monitor, target node switcher, audio feedback toggle, and rate limit telemetry.

## ☁️ Deploying to Vercel

This repository is preconfigured for **Zero-Config Vercel Deployment**:
- `vercel.json` provides rewrite rules for both the frontend SPA and the serverless `/api` backend.
- `api/index.js` acts as the serverless entry point wrapping the Express application.
- In-memory persistence fallback guarantees seamless execution in Vercel's serverless read-only environment.

### Steps to Deploy:
1. Fork or push this repository to your GitHub account: `https://github.com/Dark-Brain07/FLOOP.UNIVERSE.git`.
2. Navigate to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/new).
3. Click **"Import Project"** and select `FLOOP.UNIVERSE`.
4. Leave build settings as default (Framework Preset: **Other**).
5. Click **"Deploy"**!
